Creating small 2D game with player, obstacles, collectables and exit using mlx_lib.
The aim of this game is to collect of all collectables and to exit from the map. My version also implements the "wave algorithm" for find the shortest possible way and determ the allowed number of movements for reache the exit. If you will exeed this number you'll lose.
The "map" directory contain my ./map_generator, which also can create an incorrect maps.
